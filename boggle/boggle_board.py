Boggle board
Author: Michal Young
Revisions:    Initial version  26 Oct 2012 for CIS 210 at U. Oregon
              Feb 2013, reorganized as a class BoggleBoard
              October 2014, minor clean up of documentation

              13-Oct-2015 - Ransom and Kevin improved reformatted per PEP8 standards.

The BoggleBoard is a 4x4 matrix of tiles
where each tile represents a character
(except "qu" is a single tile).  In addition
to the character(s), each tile can be in
available or not.

The BoggleBoard also maintains a graphical depiction,
including color to show which tiles are currently
in use.

Limitations:
    Standard 4x4 board assumed throughout; 4 and 16 are
    used as 'magic numbers', making this difficult to
    adapt to non-standard boards.

    The graphics code is tangled into maintenance of the
    board ("model" mixed with "view"); we will learn how
    to factor it out in a later project.
